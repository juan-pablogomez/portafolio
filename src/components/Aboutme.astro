      I have worked for more than 3 years as a <strong> web developer</strong> using CMS such as
      <strong>Wordpress</strong> and CMRs such as SuiteCRM. I have also used cutting-edge technologies such as
      ReactJS, NextJS, Redux, NodeJS, Astro among others. <strong>My strength lies
      in building UX/UI</strong> using these technologies along with native CSS, LessCSS,
      SassCSS, Bootstrap or TailwindCSS.

      Beyond my professional work, I'm passionate about music and I
      am the founder of <strong>Corporación Licania</strong>, a nonprofit
      organization dedicated to promoting the arts in the eastern region of Antioquia
      .
